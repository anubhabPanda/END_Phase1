# Week 10 - Hands On (IV)

This assignment is based on the Week10 class and gives some practise on Neural Machine Translation using Seq2Seq and Attention Layers

## Assignment Instructions

1. Refer to both the code we covered in the class
2. write both the codes again, but this time train for English to German translation
3. Write comments covering the shape of every tensor in the code
4. Train the code for a minimum of 20 epochs each
