# Week 3 - Advanced Python for General Computing & NLP

This assignment is based on the concepts of **Advanced Python for General Computing & NLP**. These questions cover various concepts related to map, reduce, filter, lambda functions and list comprehension.

## Assignment Objective

Solve the below questions using python and given conditions:

1. Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fibonacci numbers till 10000.
2. Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write five different expressions that:
    1. Adds 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
       strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
    2. Acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
    3. Acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
    4. Takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
3. A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph (write your own paragraph to check), and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in [(Source)](https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt)
4. Using reduce functions:
   1. Add only even numbers in a list
   2. Find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
   3. Adds every 3rd number in a list
5. Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<DD<99 & 1000<DDDD<9999
6. Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided
